# Overview
In the following example, I will create a set of example pages. You can use them as guidance on how to organize your own content.
# Instructions
1. Choose the project to document.
2. Define your target audience.
3. Define the deliverable you will create for your target audience.
4. Develop the UA asset.
5. Publish the UA asset.
# Templates
To make your work easier, there are several templates that represent the different information types you can use to write your software documentation.
When writing your pages, make sure you keep the different types of information clearly separated. This means that you use:

| Information type | Description |
 --- | ---
| Concept | Use it to provide conceptual information, answering the question "What is this?" |
| Task | Use it to provide instructional information, answering the question "How to do this?" |
| Reference | Use it to provide additional information, such as a table with reference values, or additional information |
